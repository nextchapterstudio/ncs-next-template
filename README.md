# The Next Chapter Studio Next.Js Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

To create your own project run: 
```bash
`yarn create next-app [new-app-name] -e https://github.com/nextchapterstudio/ncs-next-template`
```

## Getting Started

This project requires Node and [Yarn 1 classic] (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) 

```
npm install --global yarn
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
